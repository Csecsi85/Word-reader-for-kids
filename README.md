# Word reader for kids

## Brief description:

A simple card generator from an array of words that plays an audio file corresponding to the word picked.

## Reason of doing this:

I want to play pictionary with my daughter who is not able to read well yet. So I had to read the words for her every time, but then I can't play in the game because I know the answer.

## What I'm building:

- Simple frontend UI without distractions(The word, listen, start clock, next button, picture of activity type)
- An array of words
- Countdown timer
- An array that links the voice files to a play button
- An array of possible activity types (preferably photos that describe the activity) (Act, describe or draw)
- A next button to pick a new generated word with an activity

## Any collaboration collaboration is very much appreciated so I can play this game with my daugthers during the confinement.
